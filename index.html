<h1>Bridgette Gleed</h1>
<p>Senior in Greenville, South Carolina<p>
<p>I am a second semester senior at Bob Jones University, and I am majoring in Health Science. I play post for the Bob Jonest University Women's Basetball team. I work for the Davis Field House and I am also employeed at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ChickfilAofSpartanburg">Chick-Fil-A</a>.</p>
<p>I am extremely passionate about community service in the Greenville area. I volunteer at the soup kitchen downtown, the kroc center, and plan on volunteering at the Piedmont Women's Center in the near future. I also love working in the nursery at <a href="http://www.fbs.org">First Baptist Church of Spartanburg</a>.</p>
<p>I enjoy listening to music, working out, watching television, and hanging out with my siblings when I am not doing homework. We play card games like spades, hand and foot, and spoons during our family game nights every month.
