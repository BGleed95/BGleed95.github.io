<h1>Bridgette Gleed</h1>
<p>Senior in Greenville, South Carolina<p>
<p>I am a second semester senior at Bob Jones University, and I am majoring in Health Science. I play post for the Bob Jonest University Women's Basetball team. I work for the Davis Field House and I am also employeed at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ChickfilAofSpartanburg">Chick-Fil-A</a>.</p>
<p>I am extremely passionate about community service in the Greenville area. I volunteer at the soup kitchen downtown, the kroc center, and plan on volunteering at the Piedmont Women's Center in the near future. I also love working in the nursery at <a href="http://www.fbs.org">First Baptist Church of Spartanburg</a>.</p>
<p>I enjoy listening to music, working out, watching television, and hanging out with my siblings when I am not doing homework. Playing card games is my families favorite thing to do when we are all together, so we play card games like hand and foot for hours on end.
